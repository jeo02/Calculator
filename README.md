# Calculator
A simple calculator
I took advantage of the ordering which postfix provides in order to workaround proper pemdas. Using a "stack" appraoch I was able to make this calculator. 
I created this for the odin project, however i applied what i used in data structures class in order to create a more functional calculator.
